# Storage-Space-Tracker
The client is a carrying and forwarding (C&F) agent with a warehouse, where the manufactured / shipped goods of various multinational companies are stored before they are sent to the wholesale market.
Due to increase in customers, it has become difficult for the client to manually manage the  warehouse space and ensure that there is no loss of business. 
The system that the client needs should be able to manage the warehouse space smartly and ensure that there is no loss in business by keeping spaces vacant.
